  This paper explores potential methods for automating the
  upcycling process of furniture. We

  propose a combination of image analyses in a furniture
  sorting process and the development

  of a web application for designers. By using computer
  vision and machine learning, this

  iterative design research demonstrates the feasibility of
  automating the sorting process by

  integrating visual detection of characteristics and
  defects. We present a framework for detecting

  characteristics such as the type of component, what color,
  which dimensions, and what material.

  Additionally, the process of detecting defects such as
  scratches, chips, and visible screws is

  presented. Furthermore, based on interviews and workshops,
  a user-friendly web application is

  presented with the purpose of bridging the gap between
  designers and discarded furniture.
